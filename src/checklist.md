### First Round Redo:

40: 7 POK, 9 NOK, 24 OK  
60: 7 POK, 10 NOK, 43 OK  
80: 9 POK, 11 NOK, 60 OK  
101: 13 POK, 13 NOK, 75 OK  

In the first round, it took me about 193 tomatos to complete all the practice.  
In the second round, it only took me about one-third of the time in the first round.   

### Summary of doing the problems

In the 101 algorithm problems, I’ve basically mastered 95% of them.
In terms of hours, the first round took me 96 hours,
the second round took 33 hours,
the third round I only did the 25 questions from the second round that I still wasn’t comfortable with, so it only took 10 hours.
The fourth round was another full pass, took 20 hours.But honestly this stuff is pretty rough on the nerves.
